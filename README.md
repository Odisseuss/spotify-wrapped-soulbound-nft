# Spotify Wrapper NFT Generator

![](https://github.com/spotify-wrapped-soulbound-nft/SpotifySoulbound.gif)

## Project Motivation

Who doesn't love Spotify Wrapped? For sure I do! I always wanted to make my own Wrapped on demand, and when I heard about Soulbound tokens being a thing I knew I had to combine these two things I love.

## Prerequisites

Create an account on Pinata.cloud and create an API key. Also create a Spotify app, set the redirect uri to http://localhost:3000 and get the clientId.

## How to run

Simply clone the project, add all the missing API KEYS in a .env and run:

```
npm install && npm run start
```
